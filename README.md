## BRIEF
The year is 2021 and seven months. The United States has suffered immeasurable cyber-attacks not before seen in history. The SolarWinds attack was the first in a series of crippling attacks that has left the world and this nation extremely vulnerable as 25% of the school systems have been bankrupt with ransomware as well as 40% of commercial businesses. It has been discovered by intelligence sources that this attack is in fact the work of several key nation-states that are referred to as “Dark Eyes” and physically exist sixty-six floors underground in a classified location. 

The President, upon being briefed with the new intel, signed Executive Order 65535 which grants authority to the immediate creation of secret cyber force known as, “DC540 ANGELS OF DEATH.” The intelligence sources also recommended to the President three key personnel that should make up this force. They were escorted by U.S. Secret Service to the Oval Office on the morning of July 3rd, 2021. At 7:30am of that day, the three were brought before the President and his most exclusive National Security Advisors to discuss the creation of the new secret cyber force. 

The three members who were brought forth to be a part of the elite force are Baab Fortune, Dr. Emery Riddle and Bets Fielding. The President introduced himself and explained that they will be a part of the most secret and elite cyber task force in U.S. history. He looked to Baab Fortune and said, “With your engineering skill and leadership ability you will hereby be granted Field Marshall status. You will have the entire United States Cyber Command at your disposal. Your codename will be ‘The Marshall.’” 

He turned to speak to Dr. Riddle and said, “With your advanced degree in Applied Mathematics and Cryptography you will work with the team to decode algorithms throughout this mission. Your codename will be ‘The Cipher.’” He then addressed Bets Fielding and said, “With your advanced Python Development skill and your ability to kill an enemy with over 7,000 known ways within 6 seconds you will be the sole Python expert and security force throughout this mission. Your codename will be, ‘The Assassin.’” 

To all three, the President said, “You will be transported to the classified location of the enemy which exists sixty-six floors underground. You will extract a thumb-drive in the panel floor toward the east, northeast of the room. We had SEAL Team 8 at the location on March 20th of this year, however they noticed that the Dark Eyes had scanned their vehicle, so they had to immediately depart without being noticed. One of the SEAL Team 8 members was able to extract an encrypted message that no one has been able to figure out. It is included in this brief.”

## MISSION
You have been selected by the DC540 ANGELS OF DEATH to be the Reverse Engineer on this mission.  The first task is to decrypt this strange message to which SEAL Team 8 found and report back to, "The Architect" with your results by sending a private Discord DM to Kevin Thomas.

## HINT
"Sometimes it takes a bombe to break encryption!"
